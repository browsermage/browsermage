#Hi there, I'm Björn Hjorth 👋

I like combining the web and game development, if you like what you see please do not be a stranger and say "Hi" on Twitter [@colorsofcode](https://twitter.com/colorsofcode)


- 💖 create games using web technologies
- 🔥 I make examples & small games
- 💬 As I grow older I usually prefer making games to playing them
- 💡 Still trying to figure out that SaaS game dev idea
